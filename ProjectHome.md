CytoKegg is a Cytoscape 3 app designed to identify **KEGG pathways** associated with specific **expression profiles**.

Gene expression profiles are mapped to KEGG pathways and the respective pathways are imported to  Cytoscape.

CytoKegg highlights the pathway nodes according to the expression values for each experimental condition, allows the user to change the threshold parameters for down and up-regulation and allows the user to visualize the expression changes as slideshow.

Additional information about the genes present in the expression data is retrieved from the [Gene Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/).
